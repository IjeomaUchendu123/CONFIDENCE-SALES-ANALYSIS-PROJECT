### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
- What is the overall monthly sales trend ?
- What Order Channel did sales come in from the most ?
- What are the top 3 buying states ?
- What gender buys the most ?

### DATA ANALYSIS

```Excel
=TEXT([@Date],"MMM")
```

### RESULTS.
The findings of the analysis are underlisted below;
1. The Company's sales had its peak in the month of march but thereafter recorded a steady decline in the last four months of the year.
2. The percentage of Orders that were delivered was 92% with a return rate of 3% and and a 2% rate of cancelled orders.
3. The Amazon Order Channel brought in the highest orders raking in sales of 7.52M with the second being myntra raking in sales of 4.94M.

5. Maharashthra is the state with the highest orders with haryana as the lowest.
6. The adults are the highest buying category of Customers with the elders as the least buying category.

### RECOMMENDATIONS.
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended;
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales(Month of March) and also in the month of August.
- Create exciting year-end offers that would get people to buy in the last four months of the year(Which are the months with the worst decline in sales).
- The Amazon Order channel which brought in the highest sales should be targeted for marketing efforts.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target the higher buying customers which are the adults and most especially the female adults.
- Focus on establishing more distributor base ib the highest buying state, Maharashthra.

### LIMITATIONS.
I took out a few outliers that would have skewed the outcome of my analysis.
